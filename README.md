# **Automated CV with Citation Updates**

This repository hosts my CV, which is automatically updated with my latest citation metrics and regenerated as a PDF using GitHub Actions.

## **Features**
âœ… Automatically fetches updated citation metrics from NASA ADS and Google Scholar  
âœ… Recompiles the CV using LaTeX  
âœ… Commits and pushes changes to the repository  
âœ… Publishes the updated CV as an artifact  


## **Setup**

### **Locally Compiling the CV**
1. Install LaTeX (e.g., via TeX Live or MiKTeX)  
2. Run:  
   ```sh
   xelatex cv.tex

## **GitHub Actions Workflow**
- The workflow updates citation metrics and compiles the CV.
- Private details (email, phone) are stored securely using **GitHub Secrets**.
- The compiled PDF is uploaded as an artifact and pushed to the repository.

### **Download the Latest Compiled CV**
You can always download the most up-to-date version of my CV from the **GitHub Actions artifacts** or via the latest release:

## **Security Considerations**
- `private_info.tex` is **not** tracked in Git to protect personal details.
- GitHub Secrets securely store sensitive information.
- `.github/workflows/update.yml` automates the CV update process.

## **Usage with `act` (Local Testing)**
To test the GitHub Actions workflow locally, use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act):  
```sh
act -s GH_PAT=$GH_PAT
