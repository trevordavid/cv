2019--present & \textbf{Flatiron Research Fellow}, \textit{Simons Foundation}, New York, NY\\
& $\sbullet$ Advised seven graduate and postdoctoral projects ranging from time series forecasting with recurrent neural networks to hierarchical Bayesian inference \\
& $\sbullet$ Assembled, validated, and cleaned large, heterogeneous datasets, and applied kernel density estimation methods to revise standard models of stellar wind evolution \\
& $\sbullet$ Combined heterogeneous datasets and used support vector machines to characterize an age-dependent gap in the size distribution of planets, revising evolutionary timescales of planetary atmospheres by an order of magnitude \\
& $\sbullet$ Published two lead-author papers and four second-author papers, highlighted in the Simons Foundation Annual Report cover story\\
& $\sbullet$ Exoplanet Science Lead for NASA Small Exploration Mission Concept (\$150M)\\
\\
2019--present & \textbf{Research Associate}, \textit{American Museum of Natural History}, New York, NY \\
& $\sbullet$ Advised postdoctoral researcher on measuring stellar variability periods from 200K time series\\
& $\sbullet$ Won \$100K NASA TESS GI grant for large-scale analysis of time series data \\
\\
2017--2019 & \textbf{ESI Postdoctoral Fellow}, \textit{NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory}, Pasadena, CA\\
& $\sbullet$ Applied proprietary planet search pipeline to detect low signal-to-noise signatures of eight planets in NASA Kepler time series data, increasing yield of young exoplanets by 230\%\\
